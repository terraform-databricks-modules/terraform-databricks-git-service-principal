# terraform-databricks-git-service-principal

Terraform module for creating a git repo and service principal.

This is described in the Databricks documentation [here](https://docs.databricks.com/en/repos/ci-cd-techniques-with-repos.html#use-sp-repos) but in the current version of the documentation there is a bug in the code example. This module is a working example of the code that should be used.
